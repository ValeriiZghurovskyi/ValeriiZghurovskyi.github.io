                            The Pembroke has a thick, weatherproof double coat'¿a soft, light undercoat covered by a coarse outer coat. The breed sheds a fair amount on a daily basis, and even more so in the late spring/early summer. A daily once-over with a comb and a slicker brush will remove a lot of the shed hair before it is all over the house. During shedding season, baths help to loosen the dead hairs'¿the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins'¿and a rake helps strip out the undercoat. As with all breeds, the Corgi's nails should be trimmed regularly, and ears checked to be sure they are clean and healthy.

                        <p>In conclusion, corgis are much more than their cute and distinctive 
                            appearance; they are intelligent, loyal, and loving companions. 
                            Their playful nature and distinctive looks make them a favorite 
                            among dog lovers worldwide.</p>

                Despite their short legs, corgis are energetic dogs that require regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight and prevent boredom. 
                They enjoy walks, playtime, and interactive toys. Training corgis can be a joy due to their intelligence and eagerness to please. 
                Early socialization and consistent, positive reinforcement training are important to ensure they grow into well-behaved adult dogs. 
                Corgis are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are prone to certain health issues such as hip dysplasia, degenerative 
                myelopathy, and eye conditions. Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, exercise, and proper grooming are essential for their 
                overall well-being.
