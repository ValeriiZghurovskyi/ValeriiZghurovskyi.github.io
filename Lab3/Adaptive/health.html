            <p>Owning a dog is not just a privilege; itâ€™s a
                responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum,
                food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take
                a dog into your life, you need to understand the
                commitment that dog ownership entails.</p>

            <h1>Health:</h1>
            <p>
                The Pembroke is typically a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as
                elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac issues, degenerative myelopathy, and von Willebrand's disease, a
                bleeding disorder. As with all breeds, a Pembroke's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the
                teeth should be brushed regularly.
            </p>
            <h2>Recommended Health Tests From the National Breed Club:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hip Evaluation</li>
                <li>Ophthalmologist Evaluation</li>

            <p>In conclusion, corgis are much more than their cute and distinctive
                appearance; they are intelligent, loyal, and loving companions.
                Their playful nature and distinctive looks make them a favorite
                among dog lovers worldwide.</p>

                Despite their short legs, corgis are energetic dogs that require regular exercise to maintain a healthy
                weight and
                prevent boredom.
                They enjoy walks, playtime, and interactive toys. Training corgis can be a joy due to their intelligence
                and
                eagerness to please.
                Early socialization and consistent, positive reinforcement training are important to ensure they grow
                into
                well-behaved adult dogs.
                Corgis are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are prone to certain health issues such as
                hip
                dysplasia, degenerative
                myelopathy, and eye conditions. Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, exercise, and proper
                grooming are
                essential for their
                overall well-being.
